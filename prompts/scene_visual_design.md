场景使用独立ID和状态版本；记录时间天气、门窗家具布局、背景、主要材质与道具位置。

描述主光方向、色温和强弱关系、辅助光、阴影和反射来源；避免用电影感或8K代替具体信息。

场景参考图与分镜关键画面须审核；状态变化创建新版本，不能悄悄改历史参考。

A believable person with the referenced facial geometry, natural asymmetry and source-appropriate skin texture. Preserve the supplied identity and any stated age across costume and emotional changes. Do not invent age facts, beautify, remodel facial proportions, invent markings, or smooth all skin texture.

Specify garment layers, weave, weight, seams, fit, wear, reflectance and current wetness. Costume state is separate from facial identity. Preserve approved outfit features and explicitly track changes.

A physically coherent usable location with stable doors, windows, furnishings and prop positions. Surfaces retain plausible texture, wear, roughness, reflections and scale. Lighting is motivated by specified visible or plausible sources.

Show grounded body weight, stable foot contact and deliberate hand contact. Separate each performer's initial state, one primary action, contact target and final state. Preserve who holds each prop and which hand is used.

Describe the visible framing, screen direction, focus and camera movement needed for this shot. Camera terminology is visual intent unless the workflow exposes an actual control.

Preserve each original spoken line and its speaker identity. Distinguish model instructions from guaranteed audio processing. Never certify cloned voices or lip sync without a verified workflow and actual review.

Review identities, skin, hands, contact, costumes, props, space, motion and sound. A valid decodable file is technical success only, not film quality approval. Unverified visual metrics remain unavailable.
